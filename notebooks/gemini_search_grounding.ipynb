    "### Grounding Gemini Pro with Google Search\n",
    "This notebook provides a step-by-step guide on how to ground Gemini Pro with Google Search using the Python client library. Grounding LLMs with external knowledge sources can enhance their factual accuracy and ability to answer real-world questions. Grounding with Google Search allows you to connect the model with world knowledge, a wide possible range of topics, and up-to-date information on the internet.\n",
    "\n",
    "**NOTE:** This notebook requires you to have a Google Cloud project and uses Google Cloud resources. If you are not running this lab in a Vertex AI Workbench Notebook, you need to set up the proper permissions to access these resources. Help can be found [here](https://cloud.google.com/docs/authentication/provide-credentials-adc).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**PRIVATE PREVIEW**: (developed April 18 2024) Grounding with Google Search is still in Private Preview and only available via opt-in. To opt-in to the Private Preview, you must submit this [form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfj7SJNAqXOe7vB9Re-WtwJedTWjHkBKZ6OHaLoGoXRG93ymg/viewform). Upon submission you will likely have access within 1 business day. While grounding with Google Search remains in Private Preview, this notebook will not work as intended until your Google Cloud project has access to the feature. The official documentation for Grounding with Google Search and any updates on pre-release status can be found [here](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/generative-ai/docs/grounding/overview#ground-public)."
